# About Dave

**Dave Chesser** is a dude who writes code.
Don't ask him about proper type systems or why he likes [Crystal][1]
so much or else you'll be there all night.

When he's not writing esoteric incantations on a laptop,
he draws, plays tabletop roleplaying games,
[or a number of other things](/now).
