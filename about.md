My name is Dave and this is my blog.
I'm a regular dude who writes code,
rolls dice,
lisps in parenthetical terms,
struggles to get [tenpai](https://riichi.wiki/Tenpai),
and fights his inner demons with a double-barreled shotgun.

Anything said on this blog is 100% absolutely _positively_
a **personal** opinion and does not reflect
anyone else's views.
