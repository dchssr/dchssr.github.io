Anyone else noticed that _many_ blogs' posts are exclusively about the
blog itself?
Things like a first "Hello, World!" post,
a post apologizing for not writing as much,
one about moving to a different static site generator,
or even one of the many posts get thrown onto Reddit or Hacker News
telling you to start a blog for good reason?

Yeah.
This is one of those "Hello, World!" posts;
the latest in several attempts at me starting a blog.
Unlike previously, I came prepared this time.
I collected my drafts and got cracking on something not only useful
but also one that should work on mobile devices.
You would not believe how difficult it is to make the
same site look good on a desktop _and_ a phone.
Most of that effort is in mindset and realizing content should flow
instead of breaking them down into a hundred different media queries.

Call this a manic episode if you must, but there's so much I want to
get done now.
I just hope this feeling sticks around a week later...
