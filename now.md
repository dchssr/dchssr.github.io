# What's Dave Doing?

Writing a [Now page](https://nownownow.com/about).

It's probably just blepharitis.
An eye patch does a surprisingly good job at making it not itch enough
to rub it and make it worse.
I either look like I'm a bad enough dude to rescue the president from
the ruins of New York City or like I just got dragged out of my
volcanic island evil lair complete with shag carpeting and _real_
lava lamps.

More people should take that accessibility quote to heart:
"You're only temporarily abled."
You never know when your eyesight will get ruined.
The patch _does_ look pretty cool though.
